The implement of CNN algorithms, etc.

# Basic algorithms

### Edge detection


### Gaussian blur


# SHVN problem

Dataset: SHVN (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)

I compare CNN with the neural network not using CNN. As it can be seen, CNN outperforms the other.

Note: You should not run CNN on the local machine because it is extremely slow. I test on Google Colab.
